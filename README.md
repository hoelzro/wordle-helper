# Wordle Helper

A simple single-page application to help filter Wordle words.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. Use the alphabet grid to mark letters as present or absent by clicking each tile. Enter any known letters in each position. If you need to remove a letter, click the input and choose **Clear** from the popup, or simply erase the letter. Either method now keeps the letter marked present if you had already set it that way. The page displays how many words from the list loaded from `words.txt` match your criteria.
