# Wordle Helper

A simple single-page application to help filter Wordle words.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. Use the alphabet grid to mark letters as present or absent by clicking each tile. Enter any known letters in each position. If you need to remove a letter, click the input and choose **Clear** from the popup. Using Clear empties the position without changing the letter's present/absent state. The page displays how many words from the list loaded from `words.txt` match your criteria.
